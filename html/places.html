                The mountain is located in the southern portions of the Central Highlands, 
                in the Sabaragamuwa Province and Central Province, in the Ratnapura District
                and Nuwara Eliya District, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Ratnapura
                and 32 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of Hatton. Its conical summit ends in an 
                oblong platform measuring 74 by 24 feet (22 by 7 meters), with a big hollow that 
                looks like a human foot print, measuring 5 feet 4 inches by 2 feet 6 inches.
                Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus all revere the depression, believing it to be
                the footprints of the Buddha, Adam, and iva, respectively. Every year,
                a large number of pilgrims of all faiths visit the top. The surrounding area is 
                mostly made up of forested hills.

                At 2,524 meters, Pidurutalagala, or Mount Pedro in English, is Sri Lanka's highest peak 
                and the country's tallest mountain (8,281 ft). It is located to the north-northeast of Nuwara Eliya 
                and can be seen from most parts of the Central Province. Its summit houses the Government of Sri Lanka's 
                and military forces' major communications arrays, as well as a key site in the country's radar system. 
                The mountain is currently designated as a "Ultra-high security zone" and is guarded by a major military base; 
                the public is not permitted to visit.

                Gongala is the 15th highest mountain in Sri Lanka with a height of about 4455 feet. 
                Gongala hill is a remote mountain range in the Sinharaja forest, and it is named 
                Gongala because it resembles a large rock on a bull's head. Gongala is a picturesque mountain class 
                located on the Deniyaya Rakwana road on the border of the southern and Sabaragamu provinces, 
                opposite the small Kandy light in the south.

                The last surviving relic of Sri Lanka's tropical lowland rainforest, Sinharaja Rain Forest (a UNESCO World Heritage Site),
                is located within the Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces of the south-west lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka, spanning an 
                area of 18900 acres. Sinharaja is the last viable main tropical rainforest in the country. More over 60% of the trees are
                unique to the area, and many are considered uncommon. 50 percent of Sri Lanka's native animal species (especially butterfly, 
                amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). 95 percent of the birds are native to the area. Sinharaja is surrounded on three 
                sides by rivers. Sinharaja is bordered to the north by the Napola Dola and the Koskulana Ganga. The rivers Maha Dola and Gin Ganga 
                are located to the south and south-west of the city.

                KDN, or Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya, is a forest reserve in Sri Lanka's Southern Province. 
                This forest tract is the last significant rainforest in Sri Lanka, aside from the Sinharaja Rainforest, 
                and has been identified as one of the most floristically rich places in South Asia. The forest is 
                35 kilometers northwest of Galle and serves as a major catchment region for two of Sri Lanka's most important rivers, 
                the Gin Ganga and the Nilwala Ganga. The Kanneliya forest reserve, designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 2004, 
                is home to many indigenous plant and animal species.

                'The Bridge over the River Kwai' was filmed. On the lower slope, the forest is secondary lowland rainforest, with the forest spreading up to 
                higher elevations and being contiguous with the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Makandawa Forest Reserve offers various waterfalls to explore,
